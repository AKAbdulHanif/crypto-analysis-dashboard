- **20% in Tier 2** (ASTER 10% + SONIC 6% + SYRUP 4%) = Momentum/growth

- **0% cash** = Fully deployed in confirmed rotation

   - Deploy all capital in favorable setup

### Macro Environment Summary

✅ **Positive Factors:**

- BTC dominance declining (59.43% from 65.12% peak)
- TOTAL3 holding $784B support

⚠️ **Neutral Factors:**

### Volume Analysis Highlights

**High Volume/Turnover (Bullish):**
1. SUI: $898M / $6.38B = 14.1% daily turnover
2. ASTER: $262M / $1.88B = 13.9% daily turnover ⚡
3. SONIC: $42M / $259M = 16.2% daily turnover (HIGHEST)

**Moderate Volume:**

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

The market has shifted from **consolidation** (Jan 4) to **confirmed early altcoin rotation** (Jan 5). Macro headwinds easing, BTC dominance declining, TOTAL3 holding support, and volume surges in quality altcoins justify:

1. **Increasing SUI conviction** to 50% (infrastructure leader)
2. **Adding ASTER exposure** to 10% (volume surge = accumulation)
3. **Reducing SONIC** to 6% (take profits, manage volatility)
4. **Deploying all cash** (0% reserve in confirmed rotation)

This portfolio is positioned for **Q1 2026 altcoin outperformance** with disciplined risk management and clear exit strategies.
